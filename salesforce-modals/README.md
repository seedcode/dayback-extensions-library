# Salesforce Modals from DayBack

This project contains a complete working example of how to extend the [DayBack Calendar](https://dayback.com) with **custom floating modal popovers** inside Salesforce. These modals load Visualforce pages‚Äîsuch as Chatter feeds or custom record views‚Äîdirectly above your calendar view, enhancing workflows without requiring users to leave the calendar interface.

## üß© Key Features

- Launch Visualforce modals dynamically from DayBack via custom button actions or event triggers.
- Display Salesforce Chatter activity for related records inside modals.
- Highlight events that have Chatter activity using custom icons and CSS.
- Enable secure, two-way messaging between DayBack‚Äôs canvas app and native Salesforce components.
